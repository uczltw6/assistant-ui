## 0.3.14

### Patch Changes

- [#6068](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/6068) [`ac0c836`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/ac0c8364a0f25555f693e4354d07c411e65f5489) - fix: stabilize `unstable_useAdapters` results on both adapter faces and warn on an unkeyed history factory. the React host's synthesized provider now absorbs a fresh but shallow-equal adapters bag the same way the `RemoteThreadList` store entry does, reusing the store's `useShallowStable` primitive through its internal entry, and the store entry warns in development when a history adapter arrives while the thread factory is unkeyed, since switching threads would silently keep the first thread's history.

- [#6071](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/6071) [`c3fd447`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/c3fd447f23cbaa36381b2f62058b420bd54cc148) - feat: host assistant-cloud thread lists on AISDKThreads via RemoteThreadList ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))
  
  AISDKThreads({ cloud }) uses RemoteThreadList and remounts each thread like useChatRuntime. Cloud history withFormat resolves persistence per call so one adapter can serve many threads. useExternalHistory waits for threadListItem.remoteId instead of latching on the first empty paint.

  When consecutive assistant/tool outputs are joined into one message, only the first output's metadata was kept — annotations, data, steps, custom, timing, and feedback on any later assistant message (e.g. the final answer after a tool call) were silently dropped.
  
  `unstable_annotations`, `unstable_data`, and `steps` now accumulate across every joined output, and `custom` merges with later keys overwriting earlier ones for the same key. `unstable_state`, `timing`, and `submittedFeedback` are scalar and take the last joined output's value (last-wins) — the joined message's `id`/`createdAt`/`status` are unaffected and still come from the first output.

Un-deprecate the semantically meaningful events (`thread.runStart`, `thread.runEnd`, `thread.initialize`, `composer.send`, `composer.attachmentAdd`). ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))
  
  The new event fires in situations where the deprecated pair did not, so the selection-driven defaults (`scrollToBottomOnThreadSwitch`, `unstable_focusOnThreadSwitched`) now engage there too: `InMemoryThreadList` emits on selection changes (it previously emitted no switch events at all), `switchToNewThread()` emits for the newly created thread, and runtimes that resolve a deep-linked `threadId`/`initialThreadId` after mount (`useRemoteThreadListRuntime`) emit when the deep link resolves, with the initial placeholder thread as `previousThreadId`.

  `ThreadSuggestion` gains optional `title` and `label`, so an adapter can show a
  short pill while still sending the full `prompt`. `useThreadSuggestions` now
  passes them through instead of hardcoding `title: prompt`, falling back to
  `title ?? prompt` and `label ?? ""` so prompt-only suggestions render exactly as
  before. `SuggestionConfig` is unchanged; the change is additive.

An empty config creates a client extending the `extends` client; `ref` exposes the resulting client. The `config` prop only accepts configs built with `AuiConfig(...)` (branded type). AssistantRuntimeProvider gains an optional `config` prop whose scopes are provided alongside the runtime scope. The `useAui({...})` extension overload and the AuiProvider `value` prop are deprecated; `value={client}` now exposes a client extending the given one (same scopes, new identity) rather than the exact instance. `useAui({})` with an empty scope object now mounts a rooted host (so the scope set can grow across renders) instead of a passthrough derived-only client. `useAuiState` state enumeration (`Object.keys`/spread) now includes scopes inherited from parent clients, matching `in`-operator behavior. Clients derived from a hand-built parent (a plain object with `subscribe`/`on`) forward scoped `on(...)` listeners to the parent's `on` instead of throwing for scopes the parent does not expose.

  `ExternalThreadQueueAdapter` is reshaped: `enqueue(message, { steer })` splits into

  Audio belongs on a `file` part with an `audio/*` mime type. `file` is a member of both the user and assistant unions and carries a filename, neither of which the audio part can express. The payload form a `file` part needs is still adapter specific; the message primitive docs enumerate it. The audio part and the `Unstable_Audio` slot stay honored everywhere they are accepted and will not gain fields.

  a thread list row had no supported way to tell whether its thread was running: `thread.isRunning` describes the open thread, and the item state carried no run state at all, so a run continuing on a thread the user had switched away from was invisible.

  `threadListItem.isRunning` now reports it, and stays true for a background run. runtimes that keep background threads alive answer it through the new optional `ThreadListRuntimeCore.unstable_isThreadRunning`; the rest report the open thread's run state, which they already track.

  `InMemoryThreadList` also renames threads for real instead of dropping the new title.

- [#5459](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/5459) [`22b05a4`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/22b05a43ec921a6dd7015692a77a746656a61f5f) - fix: wrap a file part payload that is not a parsable url ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `getPromptParts` put `FileMessagePart.data` straight into the OpenCode file part's `url`. OpenCode forwards that into an AI SDK file part (`sst/opencode`, `session/message-v2.ts`), whose `url` reaches an unguarded `new URL()`, so a payload that is raw base64 rather than a data URL or an http source failed there. A non-parsable payload is now wrapped in a `data:<mime>;base64,` envelope; data URLs and http sources are forwarded untouched, and a `sourceType: "id"` reference is left alone so it fails loudly instead of shipping a corrupt payload.

  The predicate behind that decision moves to `isParsableUrl` in `@assistant-ui/core/internal`, next to the `httpUrlPattern` and `parseDataUrl` it belongs with, and react-ai-sdk now imports it instead of keeping its own copy. No behavior change there.

- [#5522](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/5522) [`f913c21`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/f913c2142708d8cd1f4ac63bd801e5b6defcb74e) - feat: add the in-place refetch contract behind `threads.reloadMainThread()`. A runtime opts in with `unstable_refetchThread` on `ThreadRuntimeCore`, which an external store supplies through the new `ExternalStoreAdapter.onRefetchThread` (unrelated to `onReload`, which re-generates an assistant message) and which surfaces as `RuntimeCapabilities.refetchThread`, reporting which mechanism a call would take rather than whether it does anything. Runtimes that opt in keep their runtime identity, so composer drafts survive and messages stay rendered while the refetch runs; the rest fall back to remounting the runtime hook. Core does not stop a run in progress before calling the capability: doing that means `cancelRun`, whose contract is that the user abandoned a send, so it returns the trailing user message to the composer. An implementation owns whatever coordination a concurrent run needs. ([@taoche](https://github.com/taoche))

  The remount fallback needs the binder's React key to carry a generation, which changes it from `threadId` to `${threadId}:${generation}` for every `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` consumer rather than only for callers of the new method. One existing behaviour changes with it: a `stopThreadRuntime` followed by `startThreadRuntime` for the same id inside a single React commit used to reuse the mounted binder and now remounts it, so that binder no longer carries state from before the stop.

  No adapter registers the capability yet, so every runtime takes the remount fallback for now. `react-langgraph` adoption is [#5531](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/5531) and `react-google-adk` is [#5528](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/5528).

  `detectImageMediaType` and `dataUrlMediaType` join `parseDataUrl` and `isParsableUrl` in `@assistant-ui/core/internal`. An `ImageMessagePart` carries no media type, so an adapter that must declare one on the wire now reads it from the payload rather than assuming a format. It never throws, whatever a caller put on the part.

  react-ai-sdk and react-opencode run the same ladder rung for rung: the attachment's `contentType`, then a data URL's declared type when that is itself an image type (read whether or not the payload is base64, so an SVG data URL keeps its type), then the leading bytes, then `image/png`. Previously react-opencode had no byte rung at all, and react-ai-sdk's was skipped for any `data:` payload, so a JPEG inside a generic `application/octet-stream` envelope resolved to png on both.

  Resolving the label alone was not enough, because a data URL's own media type wins over the declared one downstream. Both adapters now rebuild the envelope when it disagrees with the resolved type and forward it untouched when it agrees. That applies to file parts too, where a `mimeType: "application/pdf"` part carrying an `application/octet-stream` envelope was announced as pdf and delivered as octet-stream. File parts also gain the same three rungs, so an empty `mimeType` falls to the envelope and then to `application/octet-stream` rather than producing a malformed `data:;base64,` url; `vercelAttachmentAdapter` emits exactly that shape for a file the OS cannot type.

  `resolveImageMediaType`, `resolveFileMediaType` and `toMediaWireUrl` join the data URL helpers in `@assistant-ui/core/internal`. react-ai-sdk and react-opencode had arrived at identical ladders and an identical wire url builder by construction rather than by sharing code, and they had already drifted apart twice while getting there. Both now call the shared functions and keep only their own part-shape plumbing.

  No behavior change: both adapters' existing suites pass untouched.

  The AI SDK message converter already kept `providerMetadata` on source parts but
  dropped it on text, reasoning, and tool-call parts (where the AI SDK surfaces it
  as `callProviderMetadata`). Provider- or app-scoped metadata such as agent
  attribution now survives the conversion to assistant-ui messages.

  The redesigned interactables API is now available as an additive `unstable_*` surface for building editable, in-message UI while preserving the existing stable API for compatibility.

  - `unstable_useInteractable(name, config)` registers an interactable and returns its state plus methods in one hook.
  - Each unstable interactable name gets one stable `update_{name}` tool. When multiple instances share a name, the tool targets an instance by `id`.
  - Thread-scoped interactables rendered inside message parts expose `version`, including the state for that message, whether it is the latest tool-driven version, and `restore()`.
  - Added `unstable_interactableTool(...)` for defining a creating tool and its in-message render UI together.
  - Added `unstable_useInteractableVersions(id, name)` for version history UIs.
  - Persistence adapters can now provide `load()` and be passed directly to `unstable_Interactables({ persistence })`.

  The previous `useAssistantInteractable` / `useInteractableState` / `Interactables` API remains available unchanged and is marked deprecated. Existing apps do not need to migrate immediately.

  Migration notes for the unstable API:

  ```diff
  - const id = useAssistantInteractable("taskBoard", config);
  - const [state, { setState }] = useInteractableState(id, initialState);
  + const [state, { id, setState }] = unstable_useInteractable("taskBoard", config);
  ```

  - Use `unstable_interactables: unstable_Interactables()` when registering the unstable scope.
  - `unstable_useInteractableState(id)` is intended for secondary readers and returns `undefined` until the owner registers.
  - The unstable API uses per-name update tools (`update_{name}`) with an `id` parameter instead of legacy per-instance tools (`update_{name}_{id}`).
  - A top-level `id` field in `stateSchema` is reserved for instance addressing. Rename domain state fields to `itemId`, `recordId`, etc. if the model should edit them.
  - Model selection should be represented as ordinary state in the unstable API; the legacy `selected` registration prop and `setSelected` method remain available on the deprecated stable API.

  these two utilities became public in [#4414](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/4414). they now carry an `@deprecated` JSDoc noting the API is experimental and may change without notice, matching how the other unstable public utilities (e.g. `bindExternalStoreMessage`) are flagged. the distribution packages (`@assistant-ui/react`, `@assistant-ui/react-native`, `@assistant-ui/react-ink`) re-export them, so the annotation lands in their published types too.

  `onSwitchToThread` already applies returned `state` via `loadExternalState`, but the history `load()` path did not, so state restored on a fresh page load was dropped. `ThreadHistoryAdapter.load()` may now return an optional `state`, and `AgUiThreadRuntimeCore` applies it — making both load paths symmetric.

  these two utilities were only reachable via `@assistant-ui/core/internal`, so materializing a `ThreadMessageLike` into a `ThreadMessage`, or generating an id for a hand-built message, meant reaching into internals (the first-party ag-ui and a2a runtimes already did). they are now exported from `@assistant-ui/core`, `@assistant-ui/react`, `@assistant-ui/react-native`, and `@assistant-ui/react-ink`. also removes the now-redundant duplicate listing of both from the unstable `INTERNAL` namespace (the one in-repo consumer, the with-ffmpeg example, now uses the public export).

  when an `ExternalStoreAdapter` drives the thread via `messageRepository`, each update tore the whole repository down (`clear()`) and rebuilt it from scratch (`import()`). it now diffs against the current repository (add or update incoming messages, delete the ones no longer present), so unchanged messages keep their existing per-message repository state instead of being recreated, and short-circuits when only `isRunning` flips on an unchanged repository reference. behavior is unchanged; this removes the teardown/rebuild churn on high-frequency streaming that previously pushed consumers to subclass the runtime core.

  - aui-build runs React Compiler over packages that depend on tap and remaps `react/compiler-runtime` to the tap shim subpath, so compiled hooks and components work both in React components and inside tap resource renders

  - tap implements `useSyncExternalStore` and a no-op `useDebugValue`; `useSubscribable` now builds on `useSyncExternalStore` so its store reads stay visible to the compiler
  - `AssistantProviderBase` opts out via `"use no memo"` because the runtime receives options through an effect inside a re-rendered child element

  `getCopyText` filtered parts with `"text" in part`, which also matched `reasoning` parts (they carry a `text` field), leaking the model's chain-of-thought into the clipboard. Both copy paths now delegate to the canonical `getThreadMessageText`, so copy returns only `type: "text"` content — consistent with the rest of the runtime.

  `ExternalThread` accepts an optional `branches` adapter (`ExternalThreadBranchAdapter` in `@assistant-ui/core`, re-exported from `@assistant-ui/react`): `getBranches(messageId)` returns ordered sibling branch ids and `switchToBranch(branchId)` makes a sibling visible by swapping the `messages` array. messages with more than one sibling get real `branchNumber`/`branchCount`, which is what shows the branch picker; `capabilities.switchToBranch` is set for parity with the legacy external store. without the adapter, behavior is unchanged.

- [#4347](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/4347) [`feecac3`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/feecac38c6ba0f8f30ec356376d1d6b19188e08f) - feat: support tool approvals on the local runtime ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `LocalRuntime.respondToToolApproval` previously threw "Local runtime does not support tool approvals". the local runtime now implements the approval gate natively, treating the `ChatModelAdapter` as the server side of the protocol: the adapter emits `approval: { id }` on a tool call part and ends the run with `requires-action`. a pending approval pauses the run (previously `shouldContinue` ignored approvals, so an unlisted tool call carrying one re-invoked the adapter in a loop). denying records the decision and synthesizes an error result (`{ error: reason || "Tool approval denied" }` with `isError: true`, matching the AI SDK v6 denial shape); approving records the decision and resumes the run once every gate on the message is decided, with the decisions readable via `unstable_getMessage()`. tool calls carrying an approval are exempt from the `unstable_humanToolNames` result requirement, and a gated call that receives a result via `addToolResult` counts as resolved, so neither combination deadlocks.

  resumed runs (from `respondToToolApproval` and `addToolResult` alike) now go through the same run loop as `startRun`: they continue multi-step turns instead of stalling after one roundtrip, emit `runStart`/`runEnd` events, mark the message queue busy so a concurrent send no longer aborts the in-flight roundtrip, and regenerate suggestions on completion. `addToolResult` also notifies subscribers when it records a result without resuming. `resumeToolCall` still throws, now with an error that points at the supported alternatives, and the `unstable_humanToolNames` JSDoc no longer describes the pause as an approval ([#4339](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/4339)).

  tool groups (and chain-of-thought groups) in `MessagePrimitive.Parts` and group nodes in `MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts` are now keyed by the id of their first part (`toolCallId`) instead of their positional index, and tool parts inside a group are keyed by their own id. when a message's parts array re-orders between live streaming and the settled shape, group and part React identity now survives the re-slice, so collapse/open state no longer resets. groups whose first part has no id keep their structural key, and duplicate ids fall back to structural keys, so keys stay unique.

  A `ResourceElement` is now `{ hook, args }` (was `{ type, props }`): the underlying hook plus the full tuple of arguments to call it with. This lets a resource take multiple positional arguments, exactly like a hook, and makes hosting just `hook(...args)`:

  ```ts
  const usePair = (a: number, b: string) => ({ a, b });
  const Pair = resource(usePair);
  const element = Pair(1, "hi"); // { hook: usePair, args: [1, "hi"] }
  ```

  The single-object case is unchanged ergonomically (`Counter({ initialValue: 0 })` still works; its `args` is just `[{ initialValue: 0 }]`), so existing resources and call sites are unaffected. `resource()`'s overloads collapse into one variadic signature, and the `fnSymbol` / `callResourceFn` indirection is gone (the element holds the hook directly; `renderResourceFiber` calls `fiber.hook(...args)`).

  Breaking (internal/advanced):
  - The second type parameter of `Resource` / `ResourceElement` / `ContravariantResource` now means the argument tuple `A extends readonly unknown[]` rather than a single payload `P`. Explicit two-arg annotations must wrap the payload in a tuple (e.g. `ResourceElement<R, [Props]>`).
  - A resource's identity is now its hook. Reading `element.props` becomes `element.args[0]`; reading `element.type` becomes `element.hook`. `attachTransformScopes` is now keyed by (and called with) the hook rather than the factory.
  - `useResource(element, deps)`'s second arg is unchanged in behavior (renamed `argsDeps`).

- [#4318](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/4318) [`1b6a0d6`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/1b6a0d6ae40b343b233c8c12ab119b13c43cb69b) - refactor: adopt the extracted-hook convention for resources ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  A resource body is a hook, so resources are now authored as a `use`-prefixed hook
  wrapped with `resource()`:

  ```ts
  const useCounter = () => { ... };
  const Counter = resource(useCounter);
  ```

  `resource()` turns a hook into a Resource; `useResource(Counter(props))` turns it
  back into a hook call. Extracting the body to a `use`-prefixed hook lets React's
  stock rules-of-hooks and exhaustive-deps lint resource bodies directly. No
  public API or runtime behavior changes.

- [#4271](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/4271) [`2a84174`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/2a8417422996920c4a58be80eddc1c1740158518) - feat: expose `joinStrategy` on `useAISDKRuntime` / `useChatRuntime` ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  the new AI SDK runtime always merged consecutive `role: "assistant"` UIMessages into a single rendered turn, with no supported way to opt out (the converter accepts `joinStrategy` but the runtime never forwarded it, and `AISDKMessageConverter` is not exported). this follows up on [#1633](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/1633), where the same knob shipped on the legacy `useVercelUseChatRuntime` as `unstable_joinStrategy`. pass `joinStrategy: "none"` to keep proactive or history loaded consecutive assistant messages as separate turns.

  core now exports a shared `JoinStrategy` type so the `"concat-content" | "none"` union has a single source of truth across the converter and the runtimes.

  the composer can now stay usable while a run is in progress: a message sent during a run is held in `composer.queue` (rendered via `ComposerPrimitive.Queue` / `QueueItemPrimitive.*`) and processed once the run settles. external-store adapters opt in by providing a `queue` adapter (typically built with the new `createMessageQueue` helper); `useLangGraphRuntime` and `useLocalRuntime` opt in via `unstable_enableMessageQueue`. `ExternalThreadQueueAdapter` now lives in `@assistant-ui/core` (still re-exported from `@assistant-ui/react`).

([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  new public exports from `@assistant-ui/core` (re-exported from `@assistant-ui/react`):
  - `ExternalStoreSharedOptions`, a typed `Pick` over `ExternalStoreAdapter` covering the four thread-level optional fields every wrapper forwards: `isDisabled`, `isSendDisabled`, `unstable_capabilities`, `suggestions`.
  - `pickExternalStoreSharedOptions(options)`, plucks those four fields from a wider options object. the body uses `satisfies Required<...>` so adding a key to the type without copying it in the function is a compile error rather than a silent missing-field bug.
  - `useExternalStoreSharedOptions(options)` (from `@assistant-ui/core/react`), a memoized variant for wrappers that wrap their store in `useMemo`. lets the wrapper list a single stable `shared` reference as a dep instead of enumerating the four fields. same `satisfies` guard internally so the destructure stays in sync with the type.

  internal: every runtime wrapper hook (`useChatRuntime`, `useAISDKRuntime`, `useLangGraphRuntime`, `useA2ARuntime`, `useAgUiRuntime`, `useAdkRuntime`, `useStreamRuntime`, `useOpenCodeRuntime`) now uses these helpers instead of inlining the conditional spreads added in [#4135](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/4135). each wrapper sheds 20 to 40 lines of duplicated declarations and conditional spreads; future additions to the shared option set propagate through a single edit in `pickExternalStoreSharedOptions` instead of touching every wrapper. no user-facing behavior change.

  Restores loading-state handling that was dropped from the grouped renderer. `GroupedParts` now emits a synthetic `{ part: { type: "indicator" } }` render call you handle with `case "indicator"` in your `switch (part.type)` — render a "thinking…" dot or any loading affordance.
  - The indicator is only ever emitted while the message is **running**, so its presence alone means "render loading UI here" — there's no `status` to branch on.
  - New `indicator` prop restricts which running states qualify: `"never"`, `"empty"` (no parts yet), `"no-text"` (default — last part isn't `text`/`reasoning`, e.g. the model ended on a tool call), or `"always"` (any running state).

([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  Messages can now be flagged `metadata.isOptimistic`. Optimistic messages are treated as ephemeral: they only ever live on the current head branch (the repository evicts off-branch optimistic messages whenever the head moves) and they are never written to persisted state (`export()` omits them). The AI SDK v6 adapter flags the streaming assistant message as optimistic, so when its client-generated id is replaced by a server-provided one mid-run, the stale placeholder no longer lingers as a phantom branch (e.g. `BranchPicker` showing `2/2` on a turn the user never branched). Unlike the reverted blanket id-diff ([#4040](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/4040)), only explicitly-optimistic messages are affected, so legitimate `onEdit` / `onReload` / `switchToBranch` branches are preserved.

([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  Tool UIs fall into three buckets: prompting the user (human-in-the-loop), informing the user (generative UI), and traces of what the model is doing (routine frontend/backend tool calls). The first two should be surfaced on their own; the last belongs folded into the chain-of-thought trace. The new `display` field on a tool lets you place a tool in the right bucket without overloading `type`:

  ```ts
  const toolkit = {
    ask_user: { type: "human", render: AskUI }, // standalone (forced — can't opt out)
    search_web: { type: "frontend", render: SearchUI }, // inline trace (default)
    checkout: {
      type: "frontend",
      render: CheckoutUI,
      display: "standalone", // opt in
    },
  } satisfies Toolkit;
  ```

  - `display?: "standalone" | "inline"` is a client-only presentation hint (it never reaches the model). Defaults to `"inline"`.
  - `human` tools are always `"standalone"` and cannot opt out (the type only allows `"standalone"`). MCP-app tool calls and the built-in generative-UI tool are standalone too. Every other tool defaults to inline and opts in explicitly.
  - `groupPartByType` gains a synthetic `"standalone-tool-call"` key that matches all of the above. `MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts` passes the live tool-UI registry to the `groupBy` function as a second `context` argument (`{ toolUIs }`), and the helper reads it to resolve the registry-driven cases; MCP-app calls are detected from the part alone.
  - The `"mcp-app"` key on `groupPartByType` is **deprecated** in favor of `"standalone-tool-call"` (a superset). It still works for back-compat.

  The shadcn `thread.tsx` template is updated to use `"standalone-tool-call": []` in place of `"mcp-app": []`.

  - In dev mode (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`), `@assistant-ui/core` now emits a single `console.warn` when it detects a second copy of itself loaded into the same JavaScript runtime. Mismatched transitive versions are a common source of subtle bugs (lost tool registrations, broken context lookups, failed `instanceof` checks — see issue [#4101](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/4101)). The warning points users at `npx assistant-ui doctor`.
  - New `assistant-ui doctor` CLI command. It walks `node_modules` recursively (including nested copies), surfaces every duplicate version of any `@assistant-ui/*`, `assistant-stream` or `assistant-cloud` package, queries the npm registry for the latest versions and reports outdated installs. Use `--no-network` to skip the registry check.

Tool-call parts in messages now fire `streamCall` / `execute` automatically for any external-store runtime that opts in. Opt in per-adapter via `unstable_enableToolInvocations: true` (off by default — most external-store runtimes either run tools server-side or already wire their own client-side dispatch path; double-firing is the risk). The `_store.isLoading` flag signals when initial history is loaded: snapshots observed while `isLoading === true` are treated as historical (no fire), matching the contract that callers like `importExternalState` already rely on. Six in-tree runtimes (`useAssistantTransportRuntime`, `useAISDKRuntime`, `useLangGraphRuntime`, `useStreamRuntime`, `useAgUiRuntime`, `useAdkRuntime`) are migrated to the embedded tracker; the standalone `useToolInvocations` React hook is removed. Adds `ExternalStoreAdapter.setToolStatuses` so adapters can mirror the tracker's per-tool-call status into local React state for converter metadata. Auto-aborts in-flight tool calls on new turns (`append()` with `startRun`, `startRun()`) so a tool that finishes after the user moves on can no longer feed a stale result into the next turn.

  - New `groupPartByType({ ... })` helper builds a `groupBy` from a `part.type → group-key path` lookup. The map keys are typed against `PartState["type"]` (autocomplete + typo rejection), missing keys leave the part ungrouped, and the returned function carries an internal memo fingerprint so the tree survives unrelated re-renders even when reconstructed inline.
  - Special map key `"mcp-app"` matches tool-call parts that point at an assistant-ui MCP app resource (`ui://...`). It takes precedence over the `"tool-call"` entry for those parts, so MCP apps can be routed separately (e.g. rendered outside a chain-of-thought wrapper).
  - `groupBy` signature simplified from `(part, index, parts) => string | string[] | null | undefined` to `(part) => readonly \`group-${string}\`[] | null`. The 2nd/3rd args were unused in practice. Arrays are required (no bare-string shorthand); `null`is accepted as an alias for`[]` to soften the migration.
  - Internal memoization now uses the helper's memo fingerprint when present, otherwise rebuilds the tree per render (O(n), cheap). The previous "pass a stable reference" advice is dropped — inline `groupBy` is fine.
  - Docs and examples updated to lead with `groupPartByType`. The `getMcpAppFromToolPart` branch in `packages/ui` switches to `"mcp-app": []` via the helper.

- [#3967](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3967) [`0a0c306`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/0a0c306286598ea885b046a1dfb85016f720051c) - feat(core, react): add `MessagePrimitive.GenerativeUI` primitive ([@samdickson22](https://github.com/samdickson22))

  A new first-class primitive for rendering agent-described React UI from a JSON
  spec, with a consumer-provided component allowlist as the security boundary.

  The agent emits a new `generative-ui` message part containing a tree of
  components by name; `MessagePrimitive.GenerativeUI` walks the spec and resolves
  each name against the registry you pass in. Unknown names throw a typed
  `GenerativeUIRenderError` (or invoke the optional `Fallback`). Composes with
  `MessagePrimitive.Parts` via the new `components.generativeUI` option, and
  supports streaming partial specs.

  ```tsx
  <MessagePrimitive.Parts
    components={{
      generativeUI: { components: { Card, Button } },
    }}
  />
  ```

  `switchToThread` (and `ThreadListItemRuntime.switchTo`) now accept an optional `{ unarchive?: boolean }` argument. The default remains `true`, preserving the existing behavior of auto-unarchiving an archived thread when it becomes the main thread. Pass `unarchive: false` to keep the thread archived after switching — useful when the UI lets users preview an archived conversation without restoring it.

  ```ts
  // existing behavior — archived thread becomes regular
  await threadList.switchToThread(threadId);

  // new — keep status as archived
  await threadList.switchToThread(threadId, { unarchive: false });

  // same option on the item runtime
  await threadListItem.switchTo({ unarchive: false });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [#4077](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/4077) [`221d320`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/221d320cee987a4cd464c9cbae152d918197499e) - fix(core|MessageParts,GroupedParts): key part fibers by absolute part index ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  Inside `MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts` and the auto-grouped
  `toolGroup` / `reasoningGroup` ranges of `MessagePrimitive.Parts`,
  leaf fibers were keyed by their **structural position** in the
  group tree rather than by the underlying part's absolute index.
  When the parts list reshaped (e.g., a thread switch with a
  different group layout), React reused the same fiber at a given
  structural slot but with a different `index` prop, keeping the
  prior tap subscription alive against an index that may now point
  at a different part or be out of range — surfacing as
  `tapClientLookup: Index N out of bounds` or
  `MessagePartText can only be used inside text or reasoning message
parts`. Keying by part index instead causes React to unmount the
  fiber when the part underneath actually changes.

Previously, copy clicks in SSR, non-HTTPS contexts, or older browsers without the Clipboard API threw a `ReferenceError`, and permission-denied rejections surfaced as unhandled promise rejections. The web copyToClipboard implementation in `@assistant-ui/react` now early-rejects when the API is unavailable, and `useActionBarCopy` in `@assistant-ui/core` silently absorbs the rejection so the rest of the UI is unaffected.

Previously the runtime silently skipped `streamCall` whenever a tool-call part arrived already-resolved (history reload, thread switch, mid-run resume, PTC sub-call surfacing), forcing fragile render-effect fallbacks. `execute` stays suppressed for these cases so side effects don't double-run. ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  Also collapses the per-tool-call ref soup inside `useToolInvocations` into a single discriminated `ToolCallEntry` map keyed by logical tool-call id, with execution-lifecycle bookkeeping tracked separately by physical stream id. Removes `ignoredToolIds`, `lastToolStates`, `toolCallIdAliasesRef` identity entries, the parallel `restoredSignaturesRef`/`preResolvedToolCallIdsRef`/`startedExecutionToolCallIdsRef` sets, and the early-return that suppressed `streamCall` for already-resolved tool calls. `reset()` semantics are unchanged; integrators that already call `reset()` on history reload don't need to change.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#3984](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3984) [`35d0146`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/35d014628a69b0003799666895c2552b46ac7198) - feat(composer): expose `canSend` state and `isSendDisabled` adapter input ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `ComposerState.canSend` (read-only) is now derivable via `useAuiState((s) => s.composer.canSend)` and `<AuiIf condition={(s) => s.composer.canSend}/>`. it reflects whether the composer is in a state where send is permitted; cross-thread gating (`isRunning`, `capabilities.queue`) continues to be layered on top by `useComposerSend`.

  `ExternalStoreAdapter.isSendDisabled` is a new optional input alongside `isDisabled`. when `true`, the thread composer's input remains usable but `send()` becomes a no-op and `canSend` is `false`. use this to gate sending on external React state (e.g. while tool config is loading) without disabling the input itself. edit composers (saving in-progress message edits) intentionally ignore this flag, since it is a thread-scoped gate.

  `BaseComposerRuntimeCore.send()` now early-returns when `!canSend`, so the `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter` steer hotkey, form-`requestSubmit()`, and direct `aui.composer().send()` calls are all gated by the same flag. the same gating is wired through the tap-based `ExternalThread` client via a new `isSendDisabled` prop on `ExternalThreadProps`.

- [#4008](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/4008) [`fa4510a`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/fa4510a3f3a23e0458ce8f3a397c352e3b0cde07) - feat: support multi-modal tool results via `toModelOutput` ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  frontend tools can now project their execution output into multi-modal model content (text + image / pdf / arbitrary file parts), aligning with the AI SDK v6 `toModelOutput` callback. previously, tool results were always serialized as a single JSON value, so a "read pdf" style tool had no way to send the PDF back to a multi-modal model.
  - `assistant-stream` exports a new `ToolModelContentPart` type (`{ type: "text", text } | { type: "file", data, mediaType, filename? }`) and a `ToolModelOutputFunction<TArgs, TResult>` callback type. `Tool.toModelOutput` is wired through `unstable_runPendingTools` and `ToolExecutionStream`, attaching the resulting `modelContent` to the `tool-call` part on the assistant message.
  - `@assistant-ui/core` re-exports `ToolModelContentPart` and adds an optional `modelContent?: readonly ToolModelContentPart[]` field on `ToolCallMessagePart`. existing tools and renderers are unchanged.
  - `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk`'s `frontendTools(...)` helper now also registers a `toModelOutput` on each forwarded tool. it transparently unwraps an envelope that `useAISDKRuntime` writes when a frontend-executed tool produced `modelContent`, turning it into AI SDK's `{ type: "content", value: [...] }` output. plain (non-envelope) outputs fall back to the existing `{ type: "text" | "json", value }` shape, so behavior for tools without `toModelOutput` is unchanged.

  route handlers that adopt `toModelOutput` also need to pass `tools` to `convertToModelMessages` (this is the [AI SDK's documented pattern](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-model-messages#multi-modal-tool-responses)):

  ```ts
  const aiSDKTools = { ...frontendTools(tools ?? {}) };
  streamText({
    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages, { tools: aiSDKTools }),
    tools: aiSDKTools,
  });
  ```

  templates and existing examples are unchanged. they keep the simpler `convertToModelMessages(messages)` form because none of the tools they ship with use `toModelOutput`. the new tools guide page documents how to opt in.

  **reserved key.** when a frontend tool defines `toModelOutput`, its result is persisted in the AI SDK chat as `{ __aui_modelContent: ToolModelContentPart[], value: <your result> }`. tools must not return objects whose top-level key is literally `__aui_modelContent`, or `convertMessage` will misread the result. the prefix is namespaced for this reason.

  **read/write compatibility for persisted threads.** the envelope is recognized by `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk` from this version onward. if you persist UI messages and read them from multiple environments, upgrade every reader before any writer starts producing `toModelOutput`; otherwise older readers will treat the envelope object as the `result` and break the affected tool `render` functions.

The runtime now synthesizes a regular thread item for `mainThreadId`, so thin adapters (e.g. `useAgUiRuntime`) that only expose `threadId` resolve correctly on first render and after switching threads.

## 0.1.18

### Patch Changes

- [#3953](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3953) [`7098bab`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/7098bab4c67fbd507c3fad746ef130daa01b3fd6) - Add cursor-based pagination to the thread list. `RemoteThreadListAdapter.list()` accepts an optional `{ after }` cursor and may return `nextCursor` on the response. The runtime exposes `loadMore()`, `hasMore`, and `isLoadingMore` through both the legacy `ThreadListRuntime` API and the tap-only `aui.threads()` path; `ThreadListRuntimeCore.loadMore?()`, `hasMore?`, and `isLoadingMore?` are optional, so non-paginating cores (local, external-store, single-thread, in-memory) remain conformant. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `@assistant-ui/react` ships a matching `ThreadListPrimitive.LoadMore` button built on `createActionButton`, plus a `useThreadListLoadMore` primitive hook. Consumers wanting an `IntersectionObserver` sentinel can read `s.threads.hasMore` / `isLoadingMore` from `useAuiState` and call `aui.threads().loadMore()` directly.

  In-flight `loadMore()` calls dedup via a single promise. The existing `_loadGeneration` counter drops stale append callbacks when a `reload()` interleaves a `loadMore()`. The loadMore reducer captures the active adapter so a mid-flight adapter swap cannot leak a stale page. Empty-string `nextCursor` is normalised to `undefined`. `reload()` pre-clears the cursor so consumers reading `hasMore` directly during a reload do not observe a stale value.

  Adapter rejections are surfaced via `console.error` in both the initial-load and `loadMore` paths, matching the pattern in `RemoteThreadListHookInstanceManager` and `useToolInvocations`.

  The `./*` wildcard in `exports` was exposing the entire dist tree as importable subpaths, which inadvertently leaked internal modules (e.g. `@assistant-ui/core/tests/*`, `@assistant-ui/core/types/*`) as public API. Removing it.

  Two attachment status types that were previously only reachable through the wildcard (`PendingAttachmentStatus`, `CompleteAttachmentStatus`) are now re-exported from the package root so that consumers' inferred types remain portable.

  The event now carries `{ reason, message, attachmentId?, error? }` so subscribers can branch on the failure mode (`no-adapter` / `not-accepted` / `adapter-error`). The bridge no longer relies on a `findLast` heuristic to recover the failed attachment id.

  Several state-derivable events are now annotated `@deprecated` because they duplicate state observation: `composer.send`, `composer.attachmentAdd`, `thread.runStart`, `thread.runEnd`, `thread.initialize`, `threadListItem.switchedTo`, `threadListItem.switchedAway`. They continue to fire for backward compatibility; new code should observe state via `useAuiState` instead.

  Users with `moduleResolution: node` in their tsconfig were seeing `Property 'message' does not exist on type 'AssistantState'` because the `exports` map sub-paths (e.g. `@assistant-ui/core/react`) are ignored by legacy node module resolution. Adding `typesVersions` makes TypeScript resolve sub-path types correctly under all moduleResolution modes.

- [#3853](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3853) [`6a919c1`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/6a919c1fa21113080f46dd0e08142c939dad3ea4) - feat: add `<MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts>` for hierarchical adjacent grouping of message parts ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

  Introduces a new primitive that coalesces adjacent parts into groups via a user-supplied `groupBy(part) → "group-…" | readonly "group-…"[] | null`. Adjacent parts sharing a key-path prefix coalesce up to that prefix; ungrouped parts render as direct leaves.

  The render function takes `{ part, children }` and dispatches on a single `switch (part.type)`. `"group-…"` cases wrap `children` (the recursively-rendered subtree); real part types (`"text"`, `"tool-call"`, `"reasoning"`, …) render the part directly with the same `EnrichedPartState` enrichments (`toolUI`, `addResult`, `resume`, `dataRendererUI`) that `<MessagePrimitive.Parts>` provides.

  `GroupPart` is intentionally minimal: `{ type, status, indices }`. The render function is invoked once per group node and once per individual leaf part, so users never have to nest a `<MessagePrimitive.Parts>` call.

  The `groupBy` return type is constrained to `` `group-${string}` `` so the unified switch can never collide with a real part type. The component infers a literal `TKey` per call site, so `part.type` narrows to the exact union of group keys plus part types.

  For leaf parts, `children` is a sentinel that throws if rendered — accidental fall-through like `default: return children;` errors loudly instead of silently rendering nothing. Returning `null` from a leaf case is fine.

  Deprecates the legacy `components.ToolGroup`, `components.ReasoningGroup`, and `components.ChainOfThought` props on `<Parts>`, and `<MessagePrimitive.Unstable_PartsGrouped>` for adjacent grouping — all still work for backwards compatibility.

- [#3896](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3896) [`976aec5`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/976aec566330bee3c607cfb356f3358eefe28ac1) - fix(core): respect `adapter.accept` when adding external `CreateAttachment` ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `composer.addAttachment` previously bypassed the configured `AttachmentAdapter` for `CreateAttachment` descriptors, including the `adapter.accept` content-type check. It now validates the descriptor's `contentType` (or filename extension) against `adapter.accept` when an adapter is configured, throwing and emitting `composer.attachmentAddError` on mismatch. Without an adapter, external attachments are still added as-is, preserving the existing "no adapter required" guarantee for external sources.

- [#3716](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3716) [`25b97d5`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/25b97d5c62fb038471b06eaa784ad4b7e23ef533) - fix(core): show loading state for empty parts children API ([@ShobhitPatra](https://github.com/ShobhitPatra))

- [#3891](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3891) [`2008fc9`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/2008fc9af3d6fe05604d6b08275c2e9cec099bd9) - fix(core): hoist remote thread runtime binder out of `unstable_Provider` ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  `RemoteThreadListAdapter.unstable_Provider` is now allowed to render any subtree it likes; the runtime binding (composer state, `__internal_setGetInitializePromise`, `runEnd → generateTitle` listener) executes outside it. This fixes `EMPTY_THREAD_ERROR` when the Provider defers `children` (e.g. behind a history-loading state) and avoids the history-switch regression seen when only the binder, but not the init listeners, were hoisted. Adds a dev-mode warning when the Provider does not render `children` within ~100ms.

- [#3889](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3889) [`88fcd35`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/88fcd352ecffd12f124abe988cc5499f784f81d6) - feat: add `custom` slot to `RemoteThreadMetadata` and `ThreadListItemState` ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

  allows adapter authors to carry arbitrary backend session data through `list()` / `fetch()` and surface it on the thread list item state. matches the existing `custom: Record<string, unknown>` convention used on `ThreadMessage`, `RunConfig`, and `ChatModelRunResult`. consumers can intersect a typed shape at their own boundary, e.g. `RemoteThreadMetadata & { custom: { workspaceId: string } }`.

- Updated dependencies [[`005f83f`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/005f83f3ebfb94b3a9d7c34bc7d2a71bbaf63a9e)]:

## 0.1.15

### Patch Changes

- [#3857](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3857) [`c7a274e`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/c7a274e968f8e081ded4c29cc37986392f04130e) - fix(core): edit composer no longer re-injects original file parts when user message attachments are modified. Non-text content parts on user messages are lifted into `_attachments` so attachment removals take effect and files aren't duplicated on resend; non-user messages keep the existing content pass-through. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3876](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3876) [`ce865bc`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/ce865bc46af996d53f89e18068139d4d38546ca6) - chore: update dependencies ([@Yonom](https://github.com/Yonom))

- [#3796](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3796) [`ca8f526`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/ca8f526944968036d47849a7659353765072a836) - feat(react-langgraph): add uiComponents option for static and dynamic data renderers ([@ShobhitPatra](https://github.com/ShobhitPatra))

  Add `uiComponents` option to `useLangGraphRuntime` for registering static data renderers by name and a `fallback` renderer for dynamic loading (e.g. LangSmith's `LoadExternalComponent`), directly from the runtime hook.

  Core `DataRenderers` scope also gains a `fallbacks` stack (plus `setFallbackDataUI` method) that the adapter registers into; resolution is `renderers[name][0]` → `fallbacks[0]` → inline `Fallback`.

- [#3873](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3873) [`c56f98f`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/c56f98f5759e710281fc57b343b41af102914f1a) - feat(core): add `reload()` method on `ThreadListRuntime` and `aui.threads()` that re-invokes the remote adapter's `list()` and refreshes the thread list. Use this after asynchronous auth (e.g. OIDC, better-auth) completes to recover from an initial load that ran before the authenticated user was available. A generation counter ensures a mid-flight response from a superseded load cannot overwrite a newer reload's state. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3855](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3855) [`974d15e`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/974d15e34675cc5a611f0297904f5cb2c1b3da8c) - fix: `useExternalStoreRuntime` now correctly initializes `mainThreadId`, `threadIds`, and `archivedThreadIds` from the adapter on first render. Previously they stayed at `DEFAULT_THREAD_ID` until the user switched threads, so `isMain` was `false` on initial load. Closes [#2577](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/issues/2577). ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3859](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3859) [`4b19d42`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/4b19d42970cb98cee6ea69e2c26dc22763091568) - fix(core): `switchToThread` could duplicate a thread or leave it in both `threadIds` and `archivedThreadIds` when it raced with `list()`. Both arrays are now filtered before the status-keyed append, matching the `updateStatusReducer` pattern. ([@bilaltahseen](https://github.com/bilaltahseen))

- [#3858](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3858) [`da0f598`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/da0f59818085c7b97d157da1260c5e20873c32c1) - fix: `useAISDKRuntime` now throws when the supplied `ThreadHistoryAdapter` omits `withFormat`, instead of silently dropping all history load/append/update calls. The optional-call chain `historyAdapter.withFormat?.(…).load()` previously short-circuited to `undefined`. The `withFormat`-wrapped adapter is now memoized, and the persist effect short-circuits when no adapter is supplied (avoiding a redundant thread subscription). `ThreadHistoryAdapter.withFormat` gains a JSDoc note clarifying that it is required on the AI SDK path. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3831](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3831) [`d53ff4f`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/d53ff4f3f8b7d7220c1cb274c4fda335598fb063) - chore: remove decorative separator comments across packages ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3872](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3872) [`20f8404`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/20f8404b70098e4b7cbc8df5bbb47985ac81b52c) - feat(core): let runtimes provide an explicit `isRunning` that overrides the last-message-status heuristic. `ExternalStoreAdapter.isRunning` now flows through to `thread.isRunning` directly, so applications can keep the thread in a running state even after the last assistant message has completed (e.g. while non-message stream chunks like suggestions, step-finish, or metadata updates are still arriving). When a runtime does not provide `isRunning`, the previous last-message-based behavior is preserved. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))

- [#3834](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/pull/3834) [`17958c9`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui/commit/17958c9234ccc42394260125df54d897c06a47fd) - refactor: unify mention/slash under behavior sub-primitives; delete Mention/SlashCommand aliases and the `execute` field on `Unstable_TriggerItem`; split TriggerPopoverResource; rename react-lexical `MentionNode`/`MentionPlugin`/`MentionChipProvider`/`mentionChip` prop to `DirectiveNode`/`DirectivePlugin`/`DirectiveChipProvider`/`directiveChip`; fix IME/Unicode/copy-paste/undo bugs. Breaking (`Unstable_` APIs): replace `onSelect={{type:"insertDirective",formatter}}` with `<Unstable_TriggerPopover.Directive formatter={...}>`; replace `onSelect={{type:"action",handler}}` with `<Unstable_TriggerPopover.Action onExecute={...}>`. Rename `unstable_useToolMentionAdapter` → `unstable_useMentionAdapter` with new `items`/`categories`/`includeModelContextTools` options. `unstable_useSlashCommandAdapter` now returns `{ adapter, action }` — `execute` stays in the hook closure instead of on the item. Rename CSS class `aui-mention-chip` → `aui-directive-chip` and attributes `data-mention-*` → `data-directive-*`. ([@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev))
